# About 

All models are in 3D, made using blender

The drones move randomly without colliding with each other. They also shoot bullets randomly. 

The player has 5 lives, and he loses a life every time he gets hit by an enemy bullet

Every time he collects a star he gains points

The background music is bomb, you might have to change some browser settings to hear it though.
